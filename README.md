# Lessons Learned
Getting better at working through each user story and being able to break each one down into manageable pieces instead of trying to take the whole thing on at once.
Learned how to break my code up into multiple different classes and then be able to have each class interact with eachother ina fairly seamless way.
Got better at implementing for/for each loops in a varity of ways and got better at learning how useful ArrayLists can be and how to use them.
Got alot better at using multiple different methods and correctly calling those methods compared to the last few weeks which helped keep the code dry and not moist.
